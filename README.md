# DISCORD-BOT
Being my first project on PYTHON, I wanted it to be something different, like I didn't want any Management System or Scaraper or anything so I choose to do this after a lot of research.
As the name is intriguing in itself, it has something to do with BOT, well of course it does!!
Here's a BOT which I have created on basic PYTHON for DISCORD. It is obviously on DISCORD community.
For this BOT you need to create your own server on DISCORD and make your BOT and then start coding it.
You can do many things with your BOT, this as I've already mentioned that is my first project, I've coded it for functionalities but trust me you can do much more than this.
This BOT talks to you, in private or in regular channel, this BOT will play music for you, it will show its status regularly changing to what you want it to be given the time period you want it to be up for, it will give information about any member in your server , it will also show server information and many more things.
In the code I've written in comments the basic guidlines to my code, it describes what each chunk of code does and how it functionalizes the BOT.
Go have a look.
It's fun!!

If you wanna try this BOT or have any queries or want any help building one you can join my DISCORD SERVER
